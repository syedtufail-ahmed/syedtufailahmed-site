    <section>
      <p>
        I am <strong>Syed Tufail Ahmed</strong>, an AI and digital transformation leader based in
        <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>, working at the intersection of technology, governance,
        and human-centered system design.
      </p>

      <p>
        With over two decades of experience across engineering, digital platforms, and
        large-scale transformation programs, my work focuses on a simple but increasingly
        critical question: <em>how do we ensure that intelligent systems remain accountable
        to human judgment, values, and authority?</em>
      </p>

      <h2>Professional Journey</h2>

      <p>
        My career began in hands-on engineering and software development, where I developed
        a deep respect for the precision, discipline, and limits of technology. Over time,
        this evolved into leading complex digital platforms and transformation initiatives
        across enterprise and public-sector environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, my work spans AI-enabled digital transformation programs, governance-aware
        system design, and leadership roles at the intersection of policy, culture, and
        emerging technology.

      <h2>Human-Centered AI Philosophy</h2>

      <p>
        While artificial intelligence continues to accelerate in capability, I believe its
        most important challenge is not technical — it is human.
      </p>

      <p>
        My work is grounded in the principle of <strong>Human-in-the-Loop AI</strong>:
        systems designed to augment human decision-making, not replace it.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Clear accountability for automated decisions</li>
        <li>Transparent and explainable system behavior</li>
        <li>Human oversight embedded into system design</li>
        <li>Respect for social, cultural, and institutional context</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Author: Human in the Loop</h2>

      <p>
        I am the author of <em>Human in the Loop: Reclaiming Human Authority in an Age of
        Intelligent Systems</em>, a book that explores how organizations and governments
        can design AI systems that remain aligned with human values and responsibility.

      <h2>Education & Credentials</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics — Bangalore University</li>
        <li>Postgraduate Executive Education in AI — Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore</li>
        <li>Project Management Professional (PMP)</li>

      <h2>Beyond Technology</h2>

      <p>
        Beyond my professional work, I write and engage in photography and cultural
        observation. These pursuits inform how I think about technology — not as an
        abstract system, but as something that intersects with real human lives.
