      <p>
        When people ask, “Who is Syed Tufail Ahmed?” the simplest answer is that I work at the intersection of
        <strong>AI, digital transformation, and human responsibility</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am an AI and digital transformation leader based in <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>, focused on building
        systems that scale—while ensuring that accountability remains with humans. My work spans large-scale platforms,
        governance-aware design, and the practical leadership required to deliver transformation in real environments,
        not just slide decks.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Core belief:</strong> Intelligent systems should amplify human judgment—not replace it.
      </div>
    </section>

      <h2>Why “Human Authority” Matters in the Age of AI</h2>

      <p>
        AI is no longer a laboratory concept. It is shaping decisions in organizations, governments, and everyday life.
        In many cases, the most serious failures are not caused by a lack of intelligence—but by a lack of
        <strong>oversight, clarity, and accountability</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        That is why I advocate for <strong>Human-in-the-Loop</strong> approaches: not as a buzzword, but as a design
        requirement. Human authority means knowing who is responsible for decisions, how automated outcomes are
        validated, and where humans must retain final judgment—especially in high-impact contexts.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Work On</h2>

      <p>
        My work focuses on designing and leading transformation programs where technology must operate within complex
        institutional environments. This includes:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI-enabled digital transformation</strong> programs and platform modernization</li>
        <li><strong>Human-centered AI</strong> systems design, governance, and oversight models</li>
        <li><strong>Large-scale digital platforms</strong> operating in regulated and public-sector contexts</li>
        <li><strong>Leadership and delivery</strong> across multi-stakeholder, multi-vendor ecosystems</li>
        <li><strong>Advisory support</strong> for founders and transformation leaders</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Author of <em>Human in the Loop</em></h2>

      <p>
        I am the author of <em>Human in the Loop: Reclaiming Human Authority in an Age of Intelligent Systems</em>.
        The book is written for leaders who are navigating the real implications of AI—where decisions affect people,
        trust, and long-term outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>
        It explores practical questions such as: How do we design accountability into AI systems? Where should humans
        intervene? What must remain human—even when automation becomes powerful?
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        If you are building AI for real-world impact, the design goal is not “more automation.” The goal is
        <strong>better decisions with clear responsibility</strong>.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How I Think About Technology Leadership</h2>

      <p>
        Transformation is not only technical—it is cultural, operational, and often political. I approach leadership as
        a blend of strategy and execution: defining the “why,” building the “how,” and ensuring the “what” gets delivered
        with quality and governance.
      </p>

      <p>
        In environments where public trust matters, responsible AI is not optional. It becomes part of the architecture,
        the process, and the leadership discipline.
